# NDVI_Soil-Degradation_Mapping-Land-Degradation-WorldWide
The primary goal of this project is to assess and visualize land degradation globally by analyzing vegetation health and coverage. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is used to detect areas with varying vegetation density and photosynthetic activity, which serves as an indicator of land degradation.
